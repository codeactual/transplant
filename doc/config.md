# Files

- The [CLI](cli.md#commands) accepts [YAML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/), [JSON](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/json/), and [TOML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/toml/) files.
- In JSON/TOML files, use the same casing as in the YAML [reference](#structure) and [examples](#examples) in this document, e.g. `FilePath`.

# Structure

## `Ops`

> This root-level section holds keys which declare the operation's ID (e.g. `github` below) for use in [`--op`](cli.md#commands) selection, while values hold the operation's configuration.

- To manage repetition or parameterize values, [user-defined and environment variables](#variables) are supported.

<!-- YAML lines need to be maintained to about this length for rendering on GitHub. -->

    # To defines where to create (or update) the standalone module.

    # Dep elements define From/To sections which perform the same function as Ops.From/Ops.To
    # sections but for shared first-party dependencies in the origin module. The exact packages

    # Dep.From.FilePath is a large tree, only the minimum packages required will be copied.
    Dep:

        # From fields here are identical to Ops.From except for the differences noted below:
      - From:

          # FilePath is the location of the dependency's file tree relative
          # to Ops.From.ModuleFilePath.
          #
          # It is the Dep version of Ops.From.LocalFilePath.
          #
          # Omit this field if the origin module contains shared first-party dependencies at
          # the root.
          #
          # - Optional
          FilePath: 'rel/path/to/dir'

          # Tests enables the same functionality as Ops.From.Tests. The important difference in
          # behavior is that all project-local tests are included when Ops.From.Tests is true.
          # Here, a test package is only included if it shares a directory with an implementation
          # package that is a direct/transitive dependency of a Ops.From.LocalFilePath package.
          # This decision is based on the conventional placement of tests in Go code, and allows
          # the copy operation to skip tests which cover implementation packages that won't be
          # included anyway.
          #
          # - Optional (default: false)
          Tests: true

          # RenameFilePath is not supported here because Ops.From.RenameFilePath already supports
          # paths relative to (From/To) ModuleFilePath values.

        # To fields here are identical to Ops.To except for the differences noted below:
        To:

          # FilePath is the location of the dependency's file tree relative
          # to Ops.To.ModuleFilePath.
          #
          # It is the Dep version of Ops.To.LocalFilePath.
          #
          # Omit this field if the copy should contain this Dep's file tree starting at the
          # root of the destination module. Otherwise select a relative path,
          # e.g. "internal/my_dep" for internal APIs.
          #
          # - Optional
          FilePath: 'rel/path/to/dir'
```

## `Template`

> This root-level section allows you to define [variables](#user-defined) available in config values of all `Ops` elements.

- Optional
- Variables **must be** used inside single/double-quoted strings.
- Keys **must be** lower-cased.

```yaml
Template:
  # Now {{.key}} can be used in any text field under Ops.
  key: 'value'
```

## `Include` and `Exclude`

> Multiple config sections support `Include` and `Exclude` pattern lists for selecting files and directories.

- `Exclude` takes precedence.
- Each pattern must be relative to its associated base path, either `Ops.From.LocalFilePath` or `Ops.Dep.From.FilePath`.
  - :information_source: Search results of an all-inclusive pattern like `**/*` will include the associated base path itself. If some/all of the direct contents of that directory need to be omitted, you will need to replace the pattern with a more specific set. For example, replace `**/*` with `target1/**/*` and `target2/**/*` in order to avoid file `skip1` and directory `skip2/`.
- [Globbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29) is supported via the [bmatcuk/doublestar](https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar#patterns) library.
- When defining recursive patterns to select directories with a named directory, such as for `GoFilePath`, it's important to decide whether to include the named directory itself or not.
  - `dirname`: selects the directory itself
  - `dirname/**/*`: selects all descendant directories (but not the directory itself)
- Examples:
  - Match all Go files at any depth under a top-level `cmd` directory:
    - `cmd/**/*.go`
  - Match directories named `subdir` at any depth and all their contents recursively:
    - `**/subdir`
    - `**/subdir/**/*`
  - Match dot-prefixed directories at any depth and all their contents recursively:
    - `**/.*`
    - `**/.*/**/*`

## `CopyOnlyFilePath`

- Go files will be minimally processed (unlike `GoFilePath` matches). They will not be analyzed or pruned, and their dependencies will not be satisfied. However they will be processed by [`format.Source`](https://golang.org/pkg/go/format/#Source) (to clean up import path rewrites). If an error occurs, such as due to syntax errors, it will not cause the run end. Instead, it will be collected in the `GoFormatErr` section of the [`--plan`](cli.md#plan-file) output.

# Precedence

## File paths

- `CopyOnlyFilePath`
- `GoDescendantFilePath`
- `GoFilePath`
  - This config matches directories instead of files, so directories containing any files matched by the above configs will be omitted from `GoFilePath` results.

Use `RenameFilePath` to match files included by the above configs.

# Variables

All config values support the variable types below.

## Program-defined

- `_config_dir`: absolute path to the config file's directory

## User-defined

The top-level [`Template`](#template) section can hold key/value pairs using the`{{.key}}` syntax.

- :warning: Variables must be used inside single/double-quoted strings.
- :warning: Keys must be lower-cased.

## Environment

Both `$key` and `${key}` formats are supported.

# Tests

To include any test packages found via `Ops.From.GoFilePath` or `Ops.Dep.From.GoFilePath`, set `Ops.From.Tests` or `Ops.Dep.From.Tests` to `true`.

# Topologies

transplant supports a variety of file tree topologies of [origin modules](README.md#origin) and the per-project copies extracted from them.

In short, the aim is to support any topology which satisfies these contraints:

- `Ops.From.LocalFilePath` must be non-empty
  - Rationale: An empty value implies the project begins at the root of the origin module, which suggests the module and project are more or less the same thing: all first-party dependencies are already a part of its file tree. This use case is outside the scope of this tool.
- `Ops.Dep.From.FilePath` is a descendant of `Ops.From.LocalFilePath`
  - Rationale: Same as above.
- One `Ops.Dep.From.FilePath` overlaps with another
  - Rationale: This suggests a higher-level file tree root should be selected instead which includes both of them. The copy will only include the packages which are directly/transitively used by the project.
- One `Ops.Dep.To.FilePath` overlaps with another
  - Rationale: Support for this would add unexplored complexity for a use case that is currently unknown. Also, if support for importing `Ops.Dep` changes from the copy back to the origin is explored, allowing this type of overlapping in the copy would likely complicate it.
